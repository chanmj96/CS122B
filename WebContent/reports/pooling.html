	<h1>Connection Pooling and Prepared Statements</h1><br>
</header>

<div id="page-text">
	We updated our servlets as per the instructions included in project 5 task 1. JDBC connection pooling is enabled in much the same way as the example 
	which is by modifying the content.xml and web.xml files as well as the appropriate Java files. The Java servlets are found in the src folder
	and only files that connect to the database were modified to accommodate connection pooling. For the most part, the process of switching from a 
	direct connection to pooling is the same across the servlet in that we commented out our variables storing the login credentials, creation of an instance
	of the JDBC driver, and establishment of a connection. Once we've commented them out, we added the necessary lines outlined in the example which were:
	<br><br>
		<div class="code-excerpt">
				<pre>
		    			Context initCtx = new InitialContext();
	    			if(initCtx == null)
	    				out.println("initCtx is NULL");
	    			
	    			Context envCtx = (Context) initCtx.lookup("java:comp/env");
	    			if(envCtx == null)
	    				out.println("envCtx is NULL");
	    			
	    			DataSource ds = (DataSource) envCtx.lookup("jdbc/MovieDB");
	    			
	    			if(ds == null)
	    				out.println("ds is NULL.");
	    			
	    			Connection dbcon = ds.getConnection();
	    			if(dbcon == null)
	    				out.println("dbcon is NULL.");
	    			</pre>	
		</div>
	For implementing prepared statements, we modified the servlets involved in the search. While we attempted to use the prepared statement format
	of parameterization, we encountered issues with the MATCH AGAINST statements due to the syntax which generated SQL syntax errors. Since the 
	statements do not change during the time of the query and only at the beginning, we defined the statement first without the use of prepared statement
	parameters and then created it into a prepared statement. The strings were completed prior to becoming prepared statement objects. This prevented the error while satisfying the requirement of making the queries into 
	prepared statements.
	
	An example of the changes can be found in src/Search.java in lines 48 to 74. The Github link is https://github.com/UCI-Chenli-teaching/cs122b-winter18-team-35/commit/c0256c738cf34900527f7125e3cc8e671c7b512c. This shows
	how we commented out the parts that performed a direct connection and added the code displayed above and found in the instructions to use pooling. Moving further down, lines 94 to 106 shows the transition to using
	prepared statements. Similar changes can be found throughout the src folder containing the Java files and servlets.
