	<h1>The LIKE Predicate</h1><br>
</header>

<div id="page-text">
<div id="why">
	<h2> Why </h2>
	We used the LIKE predicate to address situations where the user may search for a
	movie with parameters that are not entirely unique or specific enough. This allows
	the movies listing to populate with a larger amount that satisfy the basic condition
	placed by the user. In doing so, the user is not expected to know the exact details of 
	a movie such as its title, director, and cast, but give sufficient information such
	that some information may be retrieved. Needless to say, the more specific the user,
	the more accurate the information returned is.
</div>
<br>
<div id="how">
	<h2> How </h2>
	Our search and browse functions are the primary sections of our website that take
	advantage of the LIKE predicate due to their tendency to be general and not specific.
	More specifically, the user inputs the information they know whether that is the movie
	title or names of directors and cast members. The information is then passed to MySql
	where it is transformed into a query-friendly format. For the most part, movie titles
	and names make great use of the LIKE predicate whereas the year column does not. There
	does not seem to be purpose for the year to use it because a year cannot be "like"
	another year.
