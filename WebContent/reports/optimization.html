	<h1>XML Parsing Optimization</h1><br>
</header>

<div id="page-text">
Two optimization techniques we implemented were batch inserts and disabling auto-commit. Auto-commit prevents 
strenuous transactions from being committed, ultimately reducing the amount of overhead over the course of a session.
This provides us with a way to control how we perform our transactions with the database when executing statements.
Our other optimization, which is batch insert, allows for chunk commits defined by us. Our parser stores the data
in an arraylist where we take a sizeable amount and perform a transaction. These reduce the stress and overhead on
our database.
